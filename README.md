# Binary-exploitation 
Reversing Binaries is the first cyber sport started in the late 1960's according to me xD Its fun you know. Now we have CTF, people who give us a beautiful platform to explode our mind into the matrix. I recommend you to perform these exploitation on windows 7 for better understading of latest windows architecture. Choose your programming language wisely, it should be comfortable, just for that sake. And I also recommend you to play fair and support opensource.
